# NeyDB
## Project Overview
NeyDB is a distributed Key-Value Store that was inspired by Cassandra's architecture.  I decided to build this project in order to solidifiy my understanding of Distributed Systems by building an actual project.

## Goals
Not very sure why I wanna build this but
- Optimized for Writes
- DataTypes
- Data Access Mechanism
## Features
### Data Persistence
This application persists data in the File System.
### Cluster Support
This application stores data in multiple nodes.
### Fault Tolerance
This application is fault tolerant and the failure of one Node doesn't affect the others.
## Structure
### API
You can interact with NeyDB via the following interfaces
### Write API
Allows you to insert items into the database.
### Read API
Allows you to read items from the database.
### Storage Mechanism
File System is used to store data.
### Nodes and Connections
Communication is enabled via a REST interface.  
gRPC to be added in the near future.

## Architecture
This application's Architecture is publicly available at.
### Data Storage
Disk Storage
### Underlying Data Structures
Hash Tables
## Technology Stack
- Rust
- REST
## Running the application
### Building the application
- MacOS
- Linux
### Prerequisites
Have Rust installed.

## References & Guides
### Reading Material
I wouldn't have been able to build this application without these amazing resources.
